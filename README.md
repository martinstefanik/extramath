# Extramath

A LaTeX package with common mathematical commands not defined in other common packages (e.g. `\conv{A}` for convex hull of the set A) and common simplifications of other commands (e.g. `\cA` for `\mathcal{A}`).

## Installation

For installation on a Linux system, it is enough to clone the repository and run `make` in it (see `Makefile` for more details). For other systems, see this [post](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te) on StackExchange.
